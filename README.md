# windowUseTesting
This is a code for arduino that I am using to do mechanical tests on horizontal railed windows. The relays that are being controled are powering pneumatic solenoids to pressurize a pneumatic actuator attached to the window that is being tested to open and close it 10000 times. The number of times it does the opening and closing cycle are given by the brazilian standards for window testing, so it will stop every 1000 cycles for manual measuring of the strengh necessary to open and close the window.
